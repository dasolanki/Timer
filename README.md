# Timer
Timer App with Authentication 

I made this app for my Event "Inject The Bug" which was part of VYRO2K17.

This app is timer app with authentication at *stop* button and *close frame* button one cannot stop or close the timer app without authentication and even if they end process via task manager it will log the time when the app is closed.

It will log on every action performed and store the logs in a text file in 'D:\\' .

password currently set is 'itb@vyro.1' you can change it in the source code
